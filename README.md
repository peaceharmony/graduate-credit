# Graduate Credit
 
Hi,
 
This is for "Option #3 Prove Your Understanding" a React "annotated working code example"...
 
I actually never used React before Week 9 of this class.  So I wanted to follow through to learn even more about React and work on a new project for my Graduate Credit.
 
I thought it would be very interesting to actually deploy fully working React Mobile Apps on both Android and iOS.  It was a fun challenge to make an actual App that could be in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
 
When I was finished, I successfully managed to install the React App on my Android Phone and also on my iPhone and run them both.  I even joined the Apple Developer Program to do so.
 
Doing this process enabled me to have an even stronger "understanding" of React Coding of which I am able to demonstrate in this project with lots of annotated working code.
 
For a little extra, I also did "Option #2 Create a Teaching Tip" in Replit.
 
The useState React Hook was something I wanted to be a little more familiar with and saving plus updating entire objects in State I thought is something that anyone including fellow students (as mentioned in the instructions) could benefit from having an exercise to do.
 
The Challenge :
 
Save an entire Object into the useState React Hook and then (1) display the values and then (2) also provide a way to change the values.
 
The Solution :

Also, right here below are my screen pictures of the React Project compiled into 2 different deployable Store Apps running on both my iOS iPhone and Android Phone. ...Thanks!!!
